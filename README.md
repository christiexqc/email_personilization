Email Personalization

Data:  email.csv

Jupyter Notebook: personalization.jpymb

When we talk about personalization and data science, the first thing that comes to the mind is Netflix-like personalization. I.e. given that you enjoyed these movies, we think you might like these other movies. Despite the fact that that’s the kind of personalization people tend to talk about the most, in the reality it is just a small subset of the types of personalization data scientists work on, and for sure not the most common.


The most common application of personalization is something that can be well exemplified by the email dataset 
Extracting insights has helped us understand how each variable impacts the output. So, for instance, we found out that personalized as well as short emails are better, we should send emails on weekdays, etc. However, the fact that on an average short emails are better, doesn’t imply that short emails are better for every user we have. The goal of personalization is to take insights one step further and find the best email characteristics for each user. So a given user will receive a long email, another one a short one, one will receive it in the night, and one in the morning, etc.


This data challenge will describe how we can use the email dataset to come up with a personalized email strategy. This is how 90% of personalization is implemented on-line.
